The static website for HKUST Tech Club, generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)

### Hugo Setup


- [Install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) globally
- [Install yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) globally

```sh
# clone the github repository
git clone https://github.com/hkusttech/hkusttech.github.io.git


cd hkusttech.github.io        # change to the project directory
yarn                          # install dependencies
```

### GitHub page 

The following steps can be done by [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

```sh
git checkout dev             # Switch to the dev branch
git branch                   # Verify that you are in dev
git pull                     # receive the latest update
```

- `master` branch is used for the deployed website. It is required by **GitHub** for an organization page
- `dev` branch is used for hosting the source codes. 

### How to publish a new event?

- Simple. No need to modify **ANY HTML**
- Inside the `content/events` folder
  - Copy `template` folder *(or create a new folder)* as `[new event name]`
    - Put images (*.png, *.jpg, ...) and other content for this event
  - Copy `template.md` and rename it as a `[new event name].md`
    - Change from `draft: true` to `draft: false`
    - Change the date 
    - Modify the tags 
    - Edit the content using **markdown** language. [Markdown reference](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)


### How to test the website?

```sh
yarn run debug    # Debug, all draft content will be included
yarn run build    # Build the web site content in the public folder (only non-draft content will be included) 
```

### How to deploy?

The following steps can be done by [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

```sh
git checkout dev     # Switch to the dev branch 
git add .            # Added all changes 
git commit -m [msg]  # Commit all changes to the dev branch 
```

After that, run the following to deploy the `dev` branch to GitHub `master` branch

yarn run deploy      # Deploy the dev branch to the github page. 
```
