## How the system works

A 3D printing companies database organized prior to data mapping was designed using the relational model. The database holds information on 3D printing organizations where each item referred contains basic information such as organization name; attributes such as current capabilities and types; location information such as city and geolocation; and one or more pictures grouped within galleries. The database also contains information about conventional construction industry companies who collaborate with 3D printing organizations and their identified linkages. The structure of the database is shown below. All of these details have been imported to the map to allow a visualization of the information, the initial prototype can be found by following the link: https://goo.gl/JJJbUi.

I would like to build on top of what was initially done on Google maps and further implement new functionalities.
This will should likely require to build a visualization platform without the use of the Google Map APIs. 
The project will comprise of backend as well as frontend programming.
