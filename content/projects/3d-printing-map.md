## Who am I?


My name is **Lana**, I am a Ph.D. candidate from CIVL Department, HKUST. My current research focuses on the construction 3D printing industry. In addition to English, I can speak in Russian as well as Mandarin which I have been learning for several years.

## What do I want to make?

**3D printing technologies** emerges as a breakthrough in the construction industry and attracts much attention from industry experts and academics.
My study aims at creating 3D printing product and services market, which is currently at its infancy stage.  In this regards "3D Printing Technology Capability Map" was proposed in order to combine all interested entities. 

## What has been done so far?

The database containing all information has already been compiled. A prototype preview using Google My Maps is available for visualization through this [link](https://goo.gl/JJJbUi)
The relational database is organized as follows

## What is next?

Because the functionalities offered by Google My Maps are limited, I would like to now create an independent web-hosted graphical visualization of the database. 
This will facilitate the implementation of useful database query operations, ultimately offering its users the ability to filter results through queries. At the end I would like to achieve something similar to what is shown on the following figure

## Want to collaborate?

This project will be made accessible to many experts in the construction industry and academia and will therefore give all of its contributors a great chance to gain **recognition and exposure**.
I would really like to get to know and work with **driven** and **creative people**. I am looking for people who wish to assist in web development and in backend to frontend integration. 
This project can also be used as a project topic for courses such as Data Visualization *COMP 4901F*.
Thanks for your attention and please let me know in the discussions if you have any further questions or comments.
