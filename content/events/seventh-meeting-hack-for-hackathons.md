## Summary


Thank you so much to everyone who came to the meetup last Friday! And huge applause to our wonderful panelists:
- Peter Chung
- Kenta Iwasaki
- Felicia Agatha
- Isaac Zachary To
- 李婷婷

We got some meaningful insights about how to gain most out of hackathons and learnt about some of the winning strategies. Here are some of the takeaways I had:

- Don’t overlook the power of UX/UI! You only have less than 5 minutes to present.
- Actively look for the feedback of the judges. Also, during the ideating process, research on the previous work/ interest of the judges and wisely identify what they really want. At the end of the day, the winning criteria solely depend on the judging panels.
- Be familiar with a lot of libraries and frameworks before the competition. It will help you save a lot of time.
- Come up with technologically WOW factors that can impress the judges!

Hope everyone who is joining the hackUST to be excited as I am and have a lot of fun in the event. If anyone wants to share about some tips on hackathon, please comment below! Also feel free to message our wonderful panelists if you have any questions.

## What is next?

This coming Friday, we are going to have bi-weekly dinner meetup to chat, connect together and build stronger tech community! The location is TBD.
