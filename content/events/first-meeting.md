## Summary

![First Tech Club Meeting 2018](meeting-01.jpg)

Thank you so much for coming to our first meeting.
It was exciting to witness the level of interest all of you have, in technology first hand.

We have decided to create 4 groups: `Data visualization`, `React`, `algorithms` , `Decentralised systems`. The grouping would be done on slack and you would be able to join and start discussions on it. The next meeting would take place next Friday at 7pm in the CSE Commons (Rm 2446 L25-26).
The agenda would be two fold.

## What is next?

Firstly, Christine will do a show and tell on React Projectâ€™s Workflow.
Secondly, this would be followed by `hackerrank`  practice and free discussions.

Have a great weekend and an even better week ahead
